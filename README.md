# replaceRuby
This package was made to easily reproduce the ruby notation of "Shosetsuka Ni Narou" on the website. Since we are using VanillaJS, jQuery is not necessary.  
**I have not released it to npm and CDN yet. Just a moment, please.**

## Install
``` 
npm install replace-ruby
```
or
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/replace-ruby/lib/index.js"></script>

```

## How to use 
```html
<div id="replace">
  <!-- write -->
</div>
```
```javascript
import replaceRuby from "replace-ruby"; // npm used

replaceRuby('#replace');
```
